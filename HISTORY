Version 0.0.6 (2008-12-29)
  - Model
    - Changed MySQL table storage engines to InnoDB; transactions now ensure
      model correctness under many failures.
  - Controller
    - Started administration tools controller for database integrity checks
      cache refreshing, etc.
    - Admin controller allows you to update tag counts and delete unused tags.
Version 0.0.5 (2008-12-24)
  - Controller
    - More ATOM fixes/tweaks; actually works now, caches, no layout.
    - Fixed project canonicalized names checking for conflicts with journals,
      not other projects.
Version 0.0.4 (2008-12-21)
  - Controller
    - Fixed broken ATOM feeds
  - Server
    - Added caching to common indexes and feeds.
    - Added :compile_views option to config (enabled by default in production)
      which improves rendering performance
    - Switched to Thin adapter, which significantly improves performance.
    - Dump current database to disk (an SQLite file) with cortex_reaver --dump file
    - Load database from a dump with cortex_reaver --load file
      These are both pretty naive approaches, but since I haven't done anything
      really tricky in Sequel, ought to work okay. Let me know if you spot any
      inconsistencies. There is no locking, and your own database's backup 
      functionality is always best. :)
Version 0.0.3 (2008-12-18)
  - Server
    - Replaced bin/console with bin/cortex_reaver -i
  - Renderer
    - Added code syntax highlighting with <cr:code lang="foo">, using CodeRay
  - View
    - Fixed double-escaping bug in tag title display
  - Controller
    - Comment anti-spam measures
  - Outstanding bugs
    - Lots!
    - If you restart too quickly, the server can fail to rebind. Possibly
      look into sockopt?
    - If creation of a CRUD model fails, invalid associations and updated
      associated models are not rolled back.

Version 0.0.2 (2008-12-16)
  - Server
    - Menaces users right out of the box!
