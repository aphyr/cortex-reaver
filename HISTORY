Version 0.0.6 (2008-12-29)

      model correctness under many failures.

Version 0.0.5 (2008-12-24)
  - Controller
    - More ATOM fixes/tweaks; actually works now, caches, no layout.
    - Fixed project canonicalized names checking for conflicts with journals,
      not other projects.
Version 0.0.4 (2008-12-21)
  - Controller
    - Fixed broken ATOM feeds
  - Server
    - Added caching to common indexes and feeds.
    - Added :compile_views option to config (enabled by default in production)
      which improves rendering performance
    - Switched to Thin adapter, which significantly improves performance.
    - Dump current database to disk (an SQLite file) with cortex_reaver --dump file
    - Load database from a dump with cortex_reaver --load file
      These are both pretty naive approaches, but since I haven't done anything
      really tricky in Sequel, ought to work okay. Let me know if you spot any
      inconsistencies. There is no locking, and your own database's backup 
      functionality is always best. :)
