Version 0.1.0
  - General
    - Runs on Innate

    - Can now mark a journal, photo, project, or page as a draft, which does 
      not appear to people who can't edit it.
    - Caching now works on a per-user basis, in line with the new permissions
      model. This will not be an exceptional hit for most sites, as the majority
      of users are a.) anonymous and hence have the same ID, and b.) will
      appreciate not staring at random flash messages for other users.
    - Ampersands and other special HTML characters survive the round-trip in 
      editing. I'm still trying to figure out the best way to interpret 
      entities given the wide variety of contexts they could appear in.

Version 0.0.4 (2008-12-21)
  - Controller
    - Fixed broken ATOM feeds
  - Server
    - Added caching to common indexes and feeds.
    - Added :compile_views option to config (enabled by default in production)
      which improves rendering performance

    - Dump current database to disk (an SQLite file) with cortex_reaver --dump 
      file
    - Load database from a dump with cortex_reaver --load file
      These are both pretty naive approaches, but since I haven't done anything
      really tricky in Sequel, ought to work okay. Let me know if you spot any
      inconsistencies. There is no locking, and your own database's backup 
      functionality is always best. :)
