CORTEX REAVER - A dangerous Ruby blog engine, with a photographic memory.
=========================================================================

Cortex Reaver is a terrifying machine which stalks the corridors of Citadel
Station, searching for humans to assimilate into Shodan's perfection.

Cortex Reaver is also a blog engine for textual journals, photographs, and
projects; written using Ramaze and Sequel. It supports tags, comments, and
simple attachments. Features include canonically named URLs
(/journals/show/a-post-title) with conflict resolution, useful formatting
modules for content (HTML sanitizing, attachment references, BlueCloth, etc),
and custom pages.

Why Cortex Reaver
-----------------

- Adaptible. Runs on every web server and database Ramaze and Sequel support.
- Visual. Large, beautiful photographs, with concise EXIF support.
- Comprehensive. Comments, file attachments, and tags on everything.
- Devastating. The main page of Aphyr.com scales to ~400 requests/second.

Getting Started
---------------

mkdir cortex_reaver     # Create an empty directory for Cortex Reaver to lurk in.
cd cortex_reaver
cortex_reaver --migrate # Initialize an SQLite database.
cortex_reaver --start   # Start the daemon.

Then point your web browser at localhost:7000, hit control-x, and log in with
username "shodan", password "citadelstation".

You can check Cortex Reaver's status with --status, and when you're done, shut
it down with --stop.

Configuration
-------------

You'll need a YAML configuration file to define Cortex Reaver's configuration.
See proto/cortex_reaver.yaml. If no config file is specified on the command
line with --config, Cortex Reaver assumes you mean cortex_reaver.yaml in the
working directory. Copy lib/proto/cortex_reaver.yaml to get started.

Databases
---------

Cortex Reaver uses Sequel (http://sequel.rubyforge.org/), so you can (in
theory) use any database Sequel supports. By default, Cortex Reaver builds an
SQLite database in the working directory, but you can set a different database
in the config file, either as a Sequel string or with hash of options.

For MySQL:

create database cortex_reaver;
grant all privileges on cortex_reaver.* to 'cortex_reaver'@'localhost' 
  identified by 'some-password' with grant option;

When you've set up a new database, run cortex_reaver --migrate to update it to
the latest version. If you need to wipe your database and start over, use
cortex_reaver --blank to drop the schema and rebuild it.

Customization
-------------

You may find development mode useful: it reloads source files when they're
changed, displays traces for errors instead of 404 and 500 responses, logs
more, and runs in the console instead of detaching by default. Just set :mode
=> :development in your configuration.

Requests for static objects (images, css, javascript, etc.) is pulled from
public/, which can be specified in your configuration or defaults to
`cwd`/public. If a request for a file can't be found there, it's retrieved from
Cortex Reaver's own public directory in lib/public.

You can also set up your own view templates: copy lib/view to some other
directory, and specify :view_root in your configuration.

Credits
-------

I am indebted to the good folks of #sequel and #ramaze for their many
suggestions in writing Cortex Reaver, and also to Ryan Grove
(http://wonko.com), the author of the excellent (and very similar) blog system
Thoth, for invaluable advice and code. Cortex Reaver should have been a fork
of Thoth, but my schema is just too complex for the changes to be maintainable
going forward.
