CORTEX REAVER - A dangerous Ruby blog engine, with a photographic memory.

Cortex Reaver is a blog engine for textual journals, photographs, and projects;
written using Ramaze and Sequel. Supports tags, comments, and simple
attachments. Features canonically named URLs (/journals/show/a-post-title) with
conflict resolution, useful formatting modules for content (HTML sanitizing,
attachment references, BlueCloth, etc), and custom pages.

GETTING STARTED

Dependencies

First, you'll need a database. For MySQL:

create database cortex_reaver;
grant all privileges on cortex_reaver.* to 'cortex_reaver'@'localhost' 
  identified by 'some-password' with grant option;

You'll need a YAML configuration file to define Cortex Reaver's configuration.
See proto/cortex_reaver.yaml. If no config file is specified on the command
line, Cortex Reaver assumes you mean cortex_reaver.yaml in the working
directory. Copy lib/proto/cortex_reaver.yaml to a fresh directory, and run

bin/cortex_reaver -m -c path/to/cortex_reaver.yaml

To wipe the database and set up a fresh schema. Then run

bin/cortex_reaver -s -c path/to/cortex_reaver.yaml

To start the server. Cortex Reaver runs on port 7000 by default, and uses the
Mongrel adapter; you can change both of those in your configuration file.

When you visit your new site, hit control-x (or visit /users/login) to bring up
a login prompt. The default username and password are both 'shodan'. Then start
posting journals, photographs, projects, and pages!

Presumably you'll want to start changing images, stylesheets, etc. around. Just
create a directory called 'public' and specify its path in your config file.
Anything in that directory overrides Cortex Reaver's default public files.

CREDITS

I am indebted to the good folks of #sequel and #ramaze for their many
suggestions in writing Cortex Reaver, and also to Ryan Grove
(http://wonko.com), the author of the excellent (and very similar) blog system
Thoth, for invaluable advice and code. Cortex Reaver should have been a fork
of Thoth, but my schema is just too complex for the changes to be maintainable
going forward.
